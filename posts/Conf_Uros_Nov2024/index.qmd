The 2024 edition of [uRos (Use of R in Official Statistics)](http://r-project.ro/conference2024.html) conference was held in Athens, Greece on November 27th to 29th.

We gave a tutorial about (some) of the packages of the [rjdverse](https://github.com/rjdverse) family, it is available [here](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy/uRos2024-rjdverse). 

We also presented a poster which is currently travelling on its own through Europe.
