The 2025 edition of [uRos (Use of R in Official Statistics)](https://r-project.ro/conference2025.html) conference will be held in Bucharest, Romania, on November 24th to 26th.

You can submit your (short) abstract until May 30th.

I can tell you from experience that uRos is an amazing event: if your work with R you won't be disappointed.

As a new member of the organizing committee, I would be delighted to meet you in Bucharest !
