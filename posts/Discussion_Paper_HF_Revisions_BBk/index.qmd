A new Bundesbank Discussion Paper is just out: Revisions in concurrent seasonal adjustments of daily
and weekly economic time series by Karsten Webel (Deutsche Bundesbank)

Abstract

The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 has fostered in many countries the development of
new weekly economic indices for the timely tracking of pandemic-related turmoils
and other forms of rapid economic changes. Such indices often utilise information
from daily and weekly economic time series that normally exhibit complex forms
of seasonal behaviour. The latter dynamics were initially removed with ad hoc or
experimental methods due to the urgent need of instant results and hence the lack
of time for inventing and approving more sophisticated alternatives. This, never-
theless, has in turn inspired recent developments of seasonal adjustment methods
tailored to the specifics of infra-monthly time series. Although sound theoretical
descriptions of these tailored methods are already available, their performance has
not been evaluated empirically in great detail so far. To fill this gap, we consider
real-time data vintages of several infra-monthly economic time series for Germany
and analyse the cross-vintage stability of holiday-related deterministic pretreatment
effects as well as the revisions in various concurrent signal estimates obtained with
experimental STL-based and selected elaborate methods, such as the extended
ARIMA model-based and X-11 approaches. Our main findings are that the tai-
lored methods tend to outperform the experimental ones in terms of computational
speed, that the considered pretreatment routines yield generally stable parameter es-
timates across data vintages, and that the extended ARIMA model-based approach
generates the smallest and least volatile revisions in many cases.
