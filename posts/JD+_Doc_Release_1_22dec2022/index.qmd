First release of the new (revamped) JDemetra+ on-line documentation today! You can explore the [new website](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/), featuring, among other things, up-to-date information on using JDemetra+ in R and seasonal adjustment of high frequency data. It is far from being complete, but we hope it will grow fast from here ! Feel free to post issues in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/annasmyk/JD_Quarto_Book) and give us some feedback by commenting this post.
