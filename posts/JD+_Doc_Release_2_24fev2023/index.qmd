JDemetra+ on-line documentation keeps growing. The [new website](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) has up-to-date\* information on **using JDemetra+ in R** and **seasonal adjustment of high frequency data**. Chapters on seasonal adjustment and calendar correction have been significantly improved. It is a work in progress...

\*: all information might not be exactly up-to-date as the recent change in package structure is concerned. But should be very soon. (**rjd3toolkit**, **rjd3modelling**, **rjd3arima**, **rjd3sa** were merged into one **rjd3toolkit** package)

Feel free to post issues in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/annasmyk/JD_Quarto_Book) and give us some feedback by commenting this post. (To post comments you have to be connected to GitHub)
