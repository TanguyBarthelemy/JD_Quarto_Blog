Version 2.x of JDemetra (Core, GUI, Cruncher, {RJDemetra}) will be maintained until December 2026â€¦and not beyond. 

This milestone will coincide with the end of official support for Java 8.

All the corresponding repositories and files at this date will of course remain available beyond December 2026.
